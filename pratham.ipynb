However, ASER and other surveys show that a significant proportion of these children complete primary schooling without acquiring foundational reading and arithmetic skills, and therefore, are unable to cope with subsequent curricular expectations. One of Pratham’s key goals is to enable such children acquire basic reading and arithmetic skills, quickly and sustainably, so that they can meaningfully benefit from further education opportunities.', 'Pratham has developed theCAMaLpedagogy, which stands forCombined Activities for Maximised Learning, to help children “catch up”. CAMaL is a child-centered pedagogy that builds on the Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL) approach, pioneered by Pratham, that uses instructions and activities tailored and aligned to the learning level of the child.', 'At Pratham, we believe that a combination of activities helps children engage and learn. For example, reading aloud, participating in discussions on what they have read or heard, activities with phonetic charts, playing a variety of word games, expressing their own views orally and on paper – are all part of the process of learning to read. We do activities with children in large groups, small groups and individually.', 'Pratham’s foundational learning programs for 6-14 years-olds are primarily implemented in two modes:', 'Pravesh', '', 'From confined dreams to leading change, this leader mother redefines possibilities with educationread more', '', 'Dadi Rajpati', '', '65-year-old woman from Haryana passionately drives the Children’s Club in the villageread more', '', 'Aradhya', '', 'Instead of going to her grandparents house, this summer, Aradhya attended CAMaL Ka Campread more', '', 'Model:In our government partnership programs,teachers trained in Pratham’s CAMaL methodology conduct teaching-learning activities in schools. As mentioned above, children are grouped by their learning levels, using the TaRL approach, and targeted reading and arithmetic activities are conducted for 2-3 hours a day.', 'The teachers are trained, mentored and supported by a cadre of Key Resource Persons (KRPs), typically comprising block and cluster level officials as well as Pratham staff. The KRPs, who we consider as “Leaders of Practice”, are a critical pillar of Pratham’s government partnership programs. Pratham staff trains the KRPs and supports them through the practice classes they are required to run before they train teachers. The practice classes, based on the learning by doing philosophy, enable the KRPs to see first-hand the efficacy and simplicity of the CAMaL pedagogy and equip them to subsequently support and guide the teachers.

The centre promotes a culture of evidence-based decision making and seeks to develop and use simple yet rigorous methods to generate evidence on scale on the outcomes of social sector programs, especially education. It also aims to strengthen the link between evidence and action by building the capacity of individuals and institutions to design, conduct, understand and communicate the results of assessments that focus on key outcome indicators.', 'The word “aser” (pronounced uh-sir) means “impact” in Hindi and in many Indian languages. If development programs are to lead to desired outcomes, their impact on the ground should be regularly assessed. Large sums of public money are channelled into social sector programs. Information on how these investments translate into outcomes on the ground is a major indicator to evaluate their effectiveness.', 'Currently, independent, timely data on outcomes are not available, especially at the district level. In addition, outside of urban India, there is an enormous shortage of people able to design, implement, and understand the nuts and bolts of assessment. ASER Centre was established to fill these critical gaps.', 'ASER Centre’s flagship activity is theAnnual Status of Education Report(commonly known as the ASER report), a household-based survey that collects information on children’s schooling status and basic learning outcomes in almost every rural district in the country.', 'The basic nationwide ASER survey is an enormous participatory exercise that has involved about500 organisationsand upwards of25,000 volunteersevery year since 2005. Estimates of children’s schooling and learning status are generated at district, state and national levels. In 2016, ASER switched to an alternate-year model where the ‘basic’ ASER is conducted in all rural districts of the country every other year rather than annually. In the gap years, a smaller survey (typically 1-2 districts per state) focuses on other age groups and domains.', 'ASER is an annual source of data on children’s learning outcomes for India, and is often credited with changing the focus of discussions on education from inputs to outcomes. The ASER model has been adapted for use by organisations in 14 other countries across three continents. These organisations came together organically to form the People’s Action for Learning (PAL) Network, with a secretariat housed in Nairobi.', 'In addition,ASER Centre implements large- and small-scale research studies addressing a variety of domains. Conducted in collaboration with institutions such as UNICEF, the World Bank, the MacArthur Foundation, the University of Cambridge, Ambedkar University Delhi, and others, these studies seek to generate evidence that is actionable by both policy makers and practitioners.', 'ASER Centre also conducts a range of capacity building workshops on topics related to collecting and using evidence for action, both within the Pratham network as well as for partner organizations. Key features of all capacity-building modules include the integration of classroom and field activities; the constant movement between theory (or policy) and practice (or ground reality); and the use of a variety of classroom techniques (individual, small group and large group activities).', 'The basic ASER survey reaches almost every rural district in the country and covers more than15,000 villagesand650,000 children(the sample size is more than twice that of the survey rounds conducted by the government’s National Sample Survey Organization). Other research, assessment and capacity-building projects vary in reach and scale.', 'In the intervening years, ASER focuses on different aspects of children’s education and learning.

Overall, PCVC reaches around300,000childrenannually through its direct and indirect interventions.', 'PCVC strategy includes direct work with children and families in vulnerable communities. Indirect work as a resource organisation involves training of different stakeholders working in the field of child protection and partnership with necessary government departments to address these concerns.', 'PCVC addresses the issues of child rights through multipronged interventions. PCVC’s overall focus is onprevention, remediation, rehabilitation, policy advocacy and documentation for evidence-based practice.', 'One of the key programs of PCVC is to rescue child labourers from exploitative situations. The aim is to repatriate these children back to their homes and seek rehabilitative measures to sustain them in their local and home settings. To facilitate this, PCVC has established various inter-state connections with the respective government departments, at both source and receiving ends. PCVC also works at important source and receiving points at railway stations in order to mitigate unsafe migration and trafficking of children as a major prevention operation.', 'On the rehabilitation front, PCVC provides educational sponsorship for the rescued child labourers. This is for the children who attend school on a regular basis (up to 70% attendance) and their progress is monitored by PCVC staff in consultation with the schools. Another rehabilitation initiative is the Family Assistance Project which provides livelihood to the families of these vulnerable children to ensure the sustenance of children in education net and protects them from getting into any harmful practices like child labour. In the past, PCVC has run residential shelters for rescued child labourers in their home state as a demonstration of best practices for the state.', 'A crucial prevention program is the Child Rights Help Desk which is set up at various locations to address the concerns of child rights and for local community members to seek redressal for the same.

Our team is at a rather interesting niche in the organization – we interact with donors and manage those relationships, while also working with and supporting field teams on program planning and implementation.', 'My three years at Pratham have been a rollercoaster. From spending hours on train stations to eating guinea pigs in Peru to conducting elections in a village in Uttar Pradesh, Pratham has exposed me to a range of experiences that I could never have imagined. As I look back at my time in the organization, while there have been (plenty of!) moments of frustration, I would not have had it any other way.', 'I landed in Patna on a warm October night and caught a train to a district called Jamui on the edge of the state. The purpose of my trip was to visit a cluster of villages where local leaders had taken the initiative to work on children’s learning.', 'I met the cluster head with Gunjan (the Pratham staff member leading the initiative), and asked him what he would do if Pratham teams moved on from that area. He responded that they would manage on their own and that he would be that area’s Gunjan. This completely blew me away. Later, I sat under the stars talking to villagers about their aspirations for children’s learning. Their sheer enthusiasm and passion is forever ingrained in my memory.', 'Not long after this field trip, I found myself on a plane to Peru. Our team was helping the Peruvian government pilot Pratham’s teaching-learning approach in some rural schools. After a fair amount of travel, I reached a school in rural Cajamarca. It was morning, and the day’s activities were about to begin. I saw two boys come out of the classroom, collect some stones, and start playing the ‘number wheel’ game. This activity is designed to help them understand the concept of place value and had been taught in class the previous day. This was really amazing!', 'After my time in Peru, I returned to India and soon went back in Patna visiting new locations. The excitement of seeing people from India to Peru use, adapt and implement our approach fueled me and kept me awake, despite the jetlag.', 'When I look back at my time with Pratham, it has been the opportunity to work together with an extremely diverse group of individuals that has been one of the biggest highlights. From field staff in a corner of Bihar to leadership teams sitting in Delhi and Mumbai, the organization has allowed me to interact with–and more importantly learn from–a most incredible and passionate set of individuals.', 'By working on programs and developing collaborations with governments (in India or elsewhere), Pratham has given me the chance to really drive change and make my voice count. More than anything though, it has shown me the power of clear and focused action and convinced me that ambitious leaps in outcomes are possible in a future not too far from us.', 'And that’s really exciting.', '- Arjun', 'WHAT MAKES PRATHAM CLICK', 'I gaze at a book calledIn Search of Excellenceon my table,written by two ex-McKinsey consultants on what makes great ‘corporations’ click and I’m left in awe as to how Pratham, an NGO, has so intuitively, over and over again for the better part of the last two decades, managed to create an environment where everythingjust clicks.', 'Around this time last year, I knew little about the development sector. I’d worked for two years in a consulting firm and was ready to apply myobligation to dissentto a bigger context. Tired of castigating our politicians during after-work parties, I decided it was vital for me to get a sense of how things worked on the ground.At the same time, I wanted to stick to my core skill of data analysis. Measurement, Monitoring and Evaluation seemed like a natural fit, and Pratham’s work in the area immediately caught my attention.', 'Humble Beginnings', 'When I joined in October 2017, I was fortunate enough to be trusted with Pratham’s flagship program, calledRead India. I was told I’d be collaborating with more than 40 people from 10 states across India, which at the time seemed quite overwhelming! As I spent time with state-level MME teams, I realized how much effort Pratham had put in to cultivate a strong cadre of leaders in every state, an achievement few NGOs can boast of today. Data is often conveniently left out of the conversation in the social sector, yet here I was in an environment where people close to the field were discussing how our intervention could be more effective if some additional indicators were added to our monitoring formats1. I was humbled and elated to witness how strongly people in Pratham--whether our leadership in Delhi or a staff member in a remote village in Rajasthan--believed in the power of data to make better decisions.', 'Getting Into the Groove', 'In April 2018, Pratham decided to \\xa0shift its focus from learning inschoolsto learning incommunities.The goal, broadly defined, was to better understand learning levels of all children in a village and work towards improving those, involving community members in the process. That is no small task when working in 14 different states (~3500 villages) with such diversity in contexts. However, we realized we could either be discouraged by the massive scale and complexity of this problem or break it down into simpler pieces. The first step? Making sure community members understood the problem of poor learning levels in the first place.', 'The solution we came up with was avillage report card, an assessment of their own community’s learning levels led by village volunteers. From designing the report card to piloting and translating it to training team members at the state level who then conducted volunteer trainings, I was given complete freedom to call the shots. In a span of 30 days, volunteers collected data from 100,000 children across ~480 villages in 14 states2. Further, close to 70% of this data was collected on a tablet-based application we built within a week’s time! Somehow, yet again,things just clicked! From our CEO to everyone on ground, it was heartening to get such tremendous support from all ranks of the organisation, all aligned toward a unified goal. I was doing some great work a year back too, but could I compare any of it to this exercise? I doubt it.', 'Every Child Learning Well', 'As I pause the music on my phone, my colleague from our Assessment Unit excitedly shares that one of our co-founders, Dr. Madhav Chavan, plans to make learning modules on music for rural children to access via Android tablets in their villages. ‘Why limit our work to Math and Science?’,he says. Another new day, another new idea, another new experiment; \\xa0practicing ourobligation to dissentagainst traditional beliefs about education. \\xa0This pretty much sums up the one year I’ve spent at Pratham. People around me might be from a variety of backgrounds, but it is our unshakeable faith inevery child learning wellthat, I guess, makes Pratham click!', '', '- Eshan', 'THE MAGIC OF PRATHAM', 'My journey with Pratham started in May of 2012, and although it has been some time now, Pratham still makes every day feel anew. Pratham was my first job out of university, so I was eager to absorb as well as apply my psychology degree in the real world.', 'Over time, Pratham has gifted me with the opportunity to work in various capacities. I started in the People Development Unit, where I contributed to the creation of capacity building programs for people within Pratham. Most importantly, this first position taught be that training can be a ‘tool for change’. As I gained experience, I began creating content and training people in conducting Life Skills sessions for adolescents, youth and adults. This profile gave me a chance to develop content for children on various soft skills and also work with many, many teachers across the organization.', 'With the learnings from the aforementioned experiences, I was provided a platform to lead a girls’ education program working with Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalays (KGBVs). KGBVs are residential schools established for girls for girls in Upper primary grades in economically and socially backward blocks of the country. Pratham’s partnership with KGBVs is in three states: Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand. Working in these three geographies gives me immense satisfaction and a constant thirst to learn and then concretize my learning. Be it seeing the KGBV girls speak confidently about a Science experiment they learnt, hearing the stories of friendship and collaboration with teachers and wardens or watching the way my own team of 50 women is evolving in the process -- everything has been extremely fulfilling.', 'One of the best things that Pratham helped me understand is how to nurture people. Looking at how my seniors have been with me and how they provided me with a safe space to grow, I learned about the impact that strong, consistent mentorship can have. Pratham works in the field of education, and even internally I’ve been amazed at how much personal and professional growth is possible here. The people in this organization are exceptional at facilitating change, both externally and within. I believe these experiences of warmth and guidance have been instrumental in translating the same in my own work.', 'In my journey of about six years now, Pratham blessed me with three values:trust, passionandresilience. I see these in people at all levels of Pratham, from the central team where I work to the state teams and instructors across the country. \\xa0Pratham trusts its people, the energy within the organization is contagious and whenever we have a set-back, we bounce back with energy!', 'All in all, the Pratham experience is a magical one: there is magic in the work we do, the way we do it, the places Pratham takes us and the contentment at the end of the day!', '- Sukhada', 'About Us', 'About Pratham', 'Board', 'Leadership', 'Partners', 'Programs', 'Education', 'Vocational Training', 'Annual Status of Education Report', 'Pratham Council For Vulnerable Children', 'Covid Response', 'Learning Readiness & Catch Up', 'Lessons from the Pandemic', 'Get Involved', 'Job Opportunities', 'Internships', 'Delhi Office', 'B- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029Email:info@pratham.orgContact number: 01141651638', 'Mumbai Office', 'Y.B.

Facilitated by Pratham, ASER is a nation wide household survey that reaches a representative sample of children in every rural district in India. Over 600,000 children from more than 300,000 households are reached every year. A set of basic reading and arithmetic tasks are administered one on one to each sampled child.

Not only do we see a large proportion of children at low levels of reading, but the variation in each grade is wide. For example: In Std V, while 50% of all children can read Std II level text (or even higher), the rest are not yet at Std II level. Close to 18% children are only able to recognize letters or yet to acquire that skill. 13% can read simple words but not sentences and another 19% are just about reading text at Std I level. This situation presents a huge challenge to any teacher. What should a teacher teach? And to whom? In a typical Indian classroom, the Std V teacher teaches from the Std V textbook and thus only the “top of the class” benefits from her teaching.', 'ASER 2018: % Children in primary school who can read at different levelsAll India all rural districts:Representative sample of all children from household survey', '% Children in govt schools in Std III who can at least do subtraction: Selected States ASER 2018', 'The ASER 2018 graph on the left shows the proportion of Std III children enrolled in government schools who can at least do a numerical two digit subtraction problem with borrowing.

However there is wide variation across the country with stats like Kerala, Himachal Pradesh or Punjab where more than 40% children can do this correctly to states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh where this figure is lower than 15%.

Regardless of age or grade, teaching starts at the level of the child. This is what is meant by “Teaching at the Right level”. The TaRL method developed by Pratham was originally designed keeping in mind children who have already reached Std. III, IV or V but still have not acquired basic skills. The focus is on helping children with basic reading, understanding, expressing themselves as well as arithmetic skills. These are foundational building blocks that help a child to move forward. Studies have shown that once acquired these capabilities endure over time. TaRL is an effective and low-cost strategy that helps children to “catch up” in a short period of time. Children, who are 7 or 8 and older and have been in school for a few years, can “pick up” quickly.', '2.Children’s groups are made according to the basic assessment.

In the direct model, Pratham instructors run “Learning Camps”, 30-50 days of instruction (3 to 5 camps of 10 days each), for about 3 hours a day.

Since 2005, more than 90% of all children in the 6 to 14 age group have been enrolled in school. By 2010 this figure had reached 96% or more and remained that way till the pandemic. While the problem ofevery child in schoolhas been largely solved, the goal ofevery child learning wellis still far from being achieved.', 'ASERreports from 2005 to 2018 indicate a pattern of persistently low learning levels even for basic skills like reading and arithmetic. Even as late as 2018, the ASER survey showed that half of the sampled children in Grade 5 are struggling to read text at a Grade 2 level. Pratham’s efforts for the last two decades have been largely focussed on finding a solution for thislearning crisisOver the years, the approach that has evolved is calledTeaching at the Right Levelor TaRL.', 'From 2012 to 2017, Pratham had been working directly on helping children in Grade 3 and above,catch upon basic reading and arithmetic. This teaching-learning approach is calledTeaching at the Right Level(TaRL). Targeted at children enrolled in government schools in Grades 3 to 5, these intensive bursts of activity (30-50 days or 3 to 5 camps of 10 days each) ensured that by the end of the last camp more than 70% of children were able to read simple texts fluently and confidently do basic arithmetic operations.', 'Building on the successful experiences with the TaRL Learning Camps, by 2017-18, we took several more steps. These steps were based on questions like:', 'The overarching challenge was how to durably change the learning situation in a village or urban community such that at least basic skills or foundational literacy and numeracy was taken care of. In 2018, we decided that we should work for three to five years in the communities where we worked “directly”. (Direct interventions are those in which full-time Pratham team members work directly with schools and communities, children and teachers.) We felt it was possible to work towards the goal of all children reading and doing basic arithmetic. Not only could we support children to learn and thrive but also with the help of local people, create engaging learning environments in the community.', 'To continue to innovate and evolve, we started the multi-year “Hamara Gaon” (Our Village/Our Community) intervention.', 'The three-year goals included ensuring that:', 'The overall objective of Hamara Gaon was to understand how in a period of three to five years a village could be enabled in terms of ensuring basic foundations of learning for every child at least for the elementary school age group. We also envisaged Hamara Gaon to be the active laboratory where methods of teaching-learning and materials could be developed, as well as become the locations where impacts on learning could be measured and effectiveness of the approach could be shared more widely with other partners and governments.', 'The disruptions and discontinuities due to the COVID-19 pandemic led to many changes in the way that we interacted and engaged with the Hamara Gaon communities. Here are some key elements of our renewed efforts:', 'Youth Volunteers', 'A stronger push for “catch up” is needed to help children recover from the learning losses of the last two years. During the pandemic, we were able to successfully mobilize community volunteers who ran promising TaRL “catch up” learning camps in communities. Thus, along with work with teachers and schools, youth volunteers will continue to play an ongoing role in supporting children’s learning.', 'Mothers’ Groups', \"During the lockdown, we engaged directly with families of young children (pre-school age and those who were of Grade 1 and 2 age). We sent them activities to do with their children via phone messages (SMS and WhatsApp). We also connected regularly with families via phone calls for follow up and feedback. We saw mothers participating actively with their children. Young mothers were encouraged to form their own mothers' groups in the neighbourhood and get together regularly to do activities with their children. In the current version of Hamara Gaon, mothers and mother’s groups have emerged as a vital part of young children’s learning journeys.\", 'In July 2020, the Government of India launched its New Education Policy (NEP 2020).\\xa0 The document strongly recommends that acquisition of foundational literacy and numeracy in primary grades should have the highest national priority.

At their end, families have tried to support the education of their children in the best way they could. Yet, there is widespread agreement that these efforts have been largely ineffective and significantly uneven.

Schools, families, and policymakers are worried about the impact of the pandemic on children’s socio-emotional development and the extent of learning loss that may have occurred.', 'As far as schooling is concerned, the COVID crisis has brought unprecedented challenges: for example, children who are enrolled in Grade II today have never been to school and possibly have not had much exposure to pre-school education either.

Facilitated by Pratham, ASER is a nation wide household survey that reaches a representative sample of children in every rural district in India. Over 600,000 children from more than 300,000 households are reached every year. A set of basic reading and arithmetic tasks are administered one on one to each sampled child. In 2018, ASER visited 596 districts across the country.', 'Sample: ASER reading and arithmetic tool', 'Over ten years of data from the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) point to three key facts:', 'Here is a table from ASER 2018 that shows reading levels for Std III to V. Not only do we see a large proportion of children at low levels of reading, but the variation in each grade is wide. For example: In Std V, while 50% of all children can read Std II level text (or even higher), the rest are not yet at Std II level. Close to 18% children are only able to recognize letters or yet to acquire that skill. 13% can read simple words but not sentences and another 19% are just about reading text at Std I level. This situation presents a huge challenge to any teacher. What should a teacher teach? And to whom? In a typical Indian classroom, the Std V teacher teaches from the Std V textbook and thus only the “top of the class” benefits from her teaching.', 'ASER 2018: % Children in primary school who can read at different levelsAll India all rural districts:Representative sample of all children from household survey', '% Children in govt schools in Std III who can at least do subtraction: Selected States ASER 2018', 'The ASER 2018 graph on the left shows the proportion of Std III children enrolled in government schools who can at least do a numerical two digit subtraction problem with borrowing. (This kind of problem is usually found in Std II math textbooks in states). The All India figure indicates that approximately 21% of children can do this task correctly. However there is wide variation across the country with stats like Kerala, Himachal Pradesh or Punjab where more than 40% children can do this correctly to states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh where this figure is lower than 15%. If we consider these levels as a proxy for the proportion of children who are at grade level in Std III, we can see that a substantial jump is required to help children get close to grade level expectations.', 'Click here to access.', 'Over the last fifteen years, Pratham has evolved a solution called Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL) which enables children to acquire foundational skills, like reading and arithmetic quickly. Regardless of age or grade, teaching starts at the level of the child. This is what is meant by “Teaching at the Right level”. The TaRL method developed by Pratham was originally designed keeping in mind children who have already reached Std. III, IV or V but still have not acquired basic skills. The focus is on helping children with basic reading, understanding, expressing themselves as well as arithmetic skills. These are foundational building blocks that help a child to move forward. Studies have shown that once acquired these capabilities endure over time. TaRL is an effective and low-cost strategy that helps children to “catch up” in a short period of time. Children, who are 7 or 8 and older and have been in school for a few years, can “pick up” quickly.', '2.Children’s groups are made according to the basic assessment.

In the direct model, Pratham instructors run “Learning Camps”, 30-50 days of instruction (3 to 5 camps of 10 days each), for about 3 hours a day. In the partnership model, government teachers use this approach over a longer period in the school year (four to six months) with dedicated time for 1-2 hours a day.', 'Here is an example of learning improvement seen in the 2017-18 Pratham-Goverment of Karnataka Partnership Program for Std.

However, ASER and other surveys show that a significant proportion of these children complete primary schooling without acquiring foundational reading and arithmetic skills, and therefore, are unable to cope with subsequent curricular expectations. One of Pratham’s key goals is to enable such children acquire basic reading and arithmetic skills, quickly and sustainably, so that they can meaningfully benefit from further education opportunities.',\n 'Pratham has developed theCAMaLpedagogy, which stands forCombined Activities for Maximised Learning, to help children “catch up”. CAMaL is a child-centered pedagogy that builds on the Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL) approach, pioneered by Pratham, that uses instructions and activities tailored and aligned to the learning level of the child.',\n 'At Pratham, we believe that a combination of activities helps children engage and learn. For example, reading aloud, participating in discussions on what they have read or heard, activities with phonetic charts, playing a variety of word games, expressing their own views orally and on paper – are all part of the process of learning to read. We do activities with children in large groups, small groups and individually.',\n 'Pratham’s foundational learning programs for 6-14 years-olds are primarily implemented in two modes:',\n 'From confined dreams to leading change, this leader mother redefines possibilities with educationread more',\n '65-year-old woman from Haryana passionately drives the Children’s Club in the villageread more',\n 'Instead of going to her grandparents house, this summer, Aradhya attended CAMaL Ka Campread more',\n 'Model:In our government partnership programs,teachers trained in Pratham’s CAMaL methodology conduct teaching-learning activities in schools. As mentioned above, children are grouped by their learning levels, using the TaRL approach, and targeted reading and arithmetic activities are conducted for 2-3 hours a day.',\n 'The teachers are trained, mentored and supported by a cadre of Key Resource Persons (KRPs), typically comprising block and cluster level officials as well as Pratham staff. The KRPs, who we consider as “Leaders of Practice”, are a critical pillar of Pratham’s government partnership programs. Pratham staff trains the KRPs and supports them through the practice classes they are required to run before they train teachers. The practice classes, based on the learning by doing philosophy, enable the KRPs to see first-hand the efficacy and simplicity of the CAMaL pedagogy and equip them to subsequently support and guide the teachers.

The centre promotes a culture of evidence-based decision making and seeks to develop and use simple yet rigorous methods to generate evidence on scale on the outcomes of social sector programs, especially education. It also aims to strengthen the link between evidence and action by building the capacity of individuals and institutions to design, conduct, understand and communicate the results of assessments that focus on key outcome indicators.',\n 'The word “aser” (pronounced uh-sir) means “impact” in Hindi and in many Indian languages. If development programs are to lead to desired outcomes, their impact on the ground should be regularly assessed. Large sums of public money are channelled into social sector programs. Information on how these investments translate into outcomes on the ground is a major indicator to evaluate their effectiveness.',\n 'Currently, independent, timely data on outcomes are not available, especially at the district level. In addition, outside of urban India, there is an enormous shortage of people able to design, implement, and understand the nuts and bolts of assessment. ASER Centre was established to fill these critical gaps.',\n 'ASER Centre’s flagship activity is theAnnual Status of Education Report(commonly known as the ASER report), a household-based survey that collects information on children’s schooling status and basic learning outcomes in almost every rural district in the country.',\n 'The basic nationwide ASER survey is an enormous participatory exercise that has involved about500 organisationsand upwards of25,000 volunteersevery year since 2005. Estimates of children’s schooling and learning status are generated at district, state and national levels. In 2016, ASER switched to an alternate-year model where the ‘basic’ ASER is conducted in all rural districts of the country every other year rather than annually. In the gap years, a smaller survey (typically 1-2 districts per state) focuses on other age groups and domains.',\n 'ASER is an annual source of data on children’s learning outcomes for India, and is often credited with changing the focus of discussions on education from inputs to outcomes. The ASER model has been adapted for use by organisations in 14 other countries across three continents. These organisations came together organically to form the People’s Action for Learning (PAL) Network, with a secretariat housed in Nairobi.',\n 'In addition,ASER Centre implements large- and small-scale research studies addressing a variety of domains. Conducted in collaboration with institutions such as UNICEF, the World Bank, the MacArthur Foundation, the University of Cambridge, Ambedkar University Delhi, and others, these studies seek to generate evidence that is actionable by both policy makers and practitioners.',\n 'ASER Centre also conducts a range of capacity building workshops on topics related to collecting and using evidence for action, both within the Pratham network as well as for partner organizations. Key features of all capacity-building modules include the integration of classroom and field activities; the constant movement between theory (or policy) and practice (or ground reality); and the use of a variety of classroom techniques (individual, small group and large group activities).',\n 'The basic ASER survey reaches almost every rural district in the country and covers more than15,000 villagesand650,000 children(the sample size is more than twice that of the survey rounds conducted by the government’s National Sample Survey Organization). Other research, assessment and capacity-building projects vary in reach and scale.',\n 'In the intervening years, ASER focuses on different aspects of children’s education and learning. For instance, in 2017 and 2023, the survey focused on the enrollment patterns, learning levels, awareness and aspirations of rural youth aged 14-18 years. In 2019 and 2022, it focused on enrollment and school readiness of young children aged 4-8 years.',\n 'Write to us atcontact@asercentre.orgor visitasercentre.org',\n 'B- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029Email:info@pratham.orgContact number: 01141651638',\n 'Y.B.

Overall, PCVC reaches around300,000childrenannually through its direct and indirect interventions.',\n 'PCVC strategy includes direct work with children and families in vulnerable communities. Indirect work as a resource organisation involves training of different stakeholders working in the field of child protection and partnership with necessary government departments to address these concerns.',\n 'PCVC addresses the issues of child rights through multipronged interventions. PCVC’s overall focus is onprevention, remediation, rehabilitation, policy advocacy and documentation for evidence-based practice.',\n 'One of the key programs of PCVC is to rescue child labourers from exploitative situations. The aim is to repatriate these children back to their homes and seek rehabilitative measures to sustain them in their local and home settings. To facilitate this, PCVC has established various inter-state connections with the respective government departments, at both source and receiving ends. PCVC also works at important source and receiving points at railway stations in order to mitigate unsafe migration and trafficking of children as a major prevention operation.',\n 'On the rehabilitation front, PCVC provides educational sponsorship for the rescued child labourers. This is for the children who attend school on a regular basis (up to 70% attendance) and their progress is monitored by PCVC staff in consultation with the schools. Another rehabilitation initiative is the Family Assistance Project which provides livelihood to the families of these vulnerable children to ensure the sustenance of children in education net and protects them from getting into any harmful practices like child labour. In the past, PCVC has run residential shelters for rescued child labourers in their home state as a demonstration of best practices for the state.',\n 'A crucial prevention program is the Child Rights Help Desk which is set up at various locations to address the concerns of child rights and for local community members to seek redressal for the same. Child rights sessions are also conducted in schools as well as in the community to spread awareness on the child protection concerns.',\n 'PCVC also engages in national advocacy-level interventions. These interventions range from establishing inter-state coordination between various state governments and pushing the issue of child rights and protection to a higher priority on their agenda and working towards influencing significantpolicy decisions.',\n 'PCVC is a program under Pratham Mumbai Education Initiative.

Our team is at a rather interesting niche in the organization – we interact with donors and manage those relationships, while also working with and supporting field teams on program planning and implementation.',\n 'My three years at Pratham have been a rollercoaster. From spending hours on train stations to eating guinea pigs in Peru to conducting elections in a village in Uttar Pradesh, Pratham has exposed me to a range of experiences that I could never have imagined. As I look back at my time in the organization, while there have been (plenty of!) moments of frustration, I would not have had it any other way.',\n 'I landed in Patna on a warm October night and caught a train to a district called Jamui on the edge of the state. The purpose of my trip was to visit a cluster of villages where local leaders had taken the initiative to work on children’s learning.',\n 'I met the cluster head with Gunjan (the Pratham staff member leading the initiative), and asked him what he would do if Pratham teams moved on from that area. He responded that they would manage on their own and that he would be that area’s Gunjan. This completely blew me away. Later, I sat under the stars talking to villagers about their aspirations for children’s learning. Their sheer enthusiasm and passion is forever ingrained in my memory.',\n 'Not long after this field trip, I found myself on a plane to Peru. Our team was helping the Peruvian government pilot Pratham’s teaching-learning approach in some rural schools. After a fair amount of travel, I reached a school in rural Cajamarca. It was morning, and the day’s activities were about to begin. I saw two boys come out of the classroom, collect some stones, and start playing the ‘number wheel’ game. This activity is designed to help them understand the concept of place value and had been taught in class the previous day. This was really amazing!',\n 'After my time in Peru, I returned to India and soon went back in Patna visiting new locations. The excitement of seeing people from India to Peru use, adapt and implement our approach fueled me and kept me awake, despite the jetlag.',\n 'When I look back at my time with Pratham, it has been the opportunity to work together with an extremely diverse group of individuals that has been one of the biggest highlights. From field staff in a corner of Bihar to leadership teams sitting in Delhi and Mumbai, the organization has allowed me to interact with–and more importantly learn from–a most incredible and passionate set of individuals.',\n 'By working on programs and developing collaborations with governments (in India or elsewhere), Pratham has given me the chance to really drive change and make my voice count. More than anything though, it has shown me the power of clear and focused action and convinced me that ambitious leaps in outcomes are possible in a future not too far from us.',\n 'I gaze at a book calledIn Search of Excellenceon my table,written by two ex-McKinsey consultants on what makes great ‘corporations’ click and I’m left in awe as to how Pratham, an NGO, has so intuitively, over and over again for the better part of the last two decades, managed to create an environment where everythingjust clicks.',\n 'Around this time last year, I knew little about the development sector. I’d worked for two years in a consulting firm and was ready to apply myobligation to dissentto a bigger context. Tired of castigating our politicians during after-work parties, I decided it was vital for me to get a sense of how things worked on the ground.At the same time, I wanted to stick to my core skill of data analysis. Measurement, Monitoring and Evaluation seemed like a natural fit, and Pratham’s work in the area immediately caught my attention.',\n 'When I joined in October 2017, I was fortunate enough to be trusted with Pratham’s flagship program, calledRead India. I was told I’d be collaborating with more than 40 people from 10 states across India, which at the time seemed quite overwhelming! As I spent time with state-level MME teams, I realized how much effort Pratham had put in to cultivate a strong cadre of leaders in every state, an achievement few NGOs can boast of today. Data is often conveniently left out of the conversation in the social sector, yet here I was in an environment where people close to the field were discussing how our intervention could be more effective if some additional indicators were added to our monitoring formats1. I was humbled and elated to witness how strongly people in Pratham--whether our leadership in Delhi or a staff member in a remote village in Rajasthan--believed in the power of data to make better decisions.',\n 'In April 2018, Pratham decided to \\xa0shift its focus from learning inschoolsto learning incommunities.The goal, broadly defined, was to better understand learning levels of all children in a village and work towards improving those, involving community members in the process. That is no small task when working in 14 different states (~3500 villages) with such diversity in contexts. However, we realized we could either be discouraged by the massive scale and complexity of this problem or break it down into simpler pieces. The first step? Making sure community members understood the problem of poor learning levels in the first place.',\n 'The solution we came up with was avillage report card, an assessment of their own community’s learning levels led by village volunteers. From designing the report card to piloting and translating it to training team members at the state level who then conducted volunteer trainings, I was given complete freedom to call the shots. In a span of 30 days, volunteers collected data from 100,000 children across ~480 villages in 14 states2. Further, close to 70% of this data was collected on a tablet-based application we built within a week’s time! Somehow, yet again,things just clicked! From our CEO to everyone on ground, it was heartening to get such tremendous support from all ranks of the organisation, all aligned toward a unified goal. I was doing some great work a year back too, but could I compare any of it to this exercise? I doubt it.',\n 'As I pause the music on my phone, my colleague from our Assessment Unit excitedly shares that one of our co-founders, Dr. Madhav Chavan, plans to make learning modules on music for rural children to access via Android tablets in their villages. ‘Why limit our work to Math and Science?’,he says. Another new day, another new idea, another new experiment; \\xa0practicing ourobligation to dissentagainst traditional beliefs about education. \\xa0This pretty much sums up the one year I’ve spent at Pratham. People around me might be from a variety of backgrounds, but it is our unshakeable faith inevery child learning wellthat, I guess, makes Pratham click!',\n 'My journey with Pratham started in May of 2012, and although it has been some time now, Pratham still makes every day feel anew. Pratham was my first job out of university, so I was eager to absorb as well as apply my psychology degree in the real world.',\n 'Over time, Pratham has gifted me with the opportunity to work in various capacities. I started in the People Development Unit, where I contributed to the creation of capacity building programs for people within Pratham. Most importantly, this first position taught be that training can be a ‘tool for change’. As I gained experience, I began creating content and training people in conducting Life Skills sessions for adolescents, youth and adults. This profile gave me a chance to develop content for children on various soft skills and also work with many, many teachers across the organization.',\n 'With the learnings from the aforementioned experiences, I was provided a platform to lead a girls’ education program working with Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalays (KGBVs). KGBVs are residential schools established for girls for girls in Upper primary grades in economically and socially backward blocks of the country. Pratham’s partnership with KGBVs is in three states: Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand. Working in these three geographies gives me immense satisfaction and a constant thirst to learn and then concretize my learning. Be it seeing the KGBV girls speak confidently about a Science experiment they learnt, hearing the stories of friendship and collaboration with teachers and wardens or watching the way my own team of 50 women is evolving in the process -- everything has been extremely fulfilling.',\n 'One of the best things that Pratham helped me understand is how to nurture people. Looking at how my seniors have been with me and how they provided me with a safe space to grow, I learned about the impact that strong, consistent mentorship can have. Pratham works in the field of education, and even internally I’ve been amazed at how much personal and professional growth is possible here. The people in this organization are exceptional at facilitating change, both externally and within. I believe these experiences of warmth and guidance have been instrumental in translating the same in my own work.',\n 'In my journey of about six years now, Pratham blessed me with three values:trust, passionandresilience. I see these in people at all levels of Pratham, from the central team where I work to the state teams and instructors across the country. \\xa0Pratham trusts its people, the energy within the organization is contagious and whenever we have a set-back, we bounce back with energy!',\n 'All in all, the Pratham experience is a magical one: there is magic in the work we do, the way we do it, the places Pratham takes us and the contentment at the end of the day!',\n 'B- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029Email:info@pratham.orgContact number: 01141651638',\n 'Y.B.

With almost all children in school, the critical question facing the country is – are children learning?',\n 'Since 2005, ASER - the Annual Status of Education Report - has attempted to answer this question. Facilitated by Pratham, ASER is a nation wide household survey that reaches a representative sample of children in every rural district in India. Over 600,000 children from more than 300,000 households are reached every year. A set of basic reading and arithmetic tasks are administered one on one to each sampled child. In 2018, ASER visited 596 districts across the country.',\n 'Sample: ASER reading and arithmetic tool',\n 'Over ten years of data from the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) point to three key facts:',\n 'Here is a table from ASER 2018 that shows reading levels for Std III to V. Not only do we see a large proportion of children at low levels of reading, but the variation in each grade is wide. For example: In Std V, while 50% of all children can read Std II level text (or even higher), the rest are not yet at Std II level. Close to 18% children are only able to recognize letters or yet to acquire that skill. 13% can read simple words but not sentences and another 19% are just about reading text at Std I level. This situation presents a huge challenge to any teacher. What should a teacher teach? And to whom? In a typical Indian classroom, the Std V teacher teaches from the Std V textbook and thus only the “top of the class” benefits from her teaching.',\n 'ASER 2018: % Children in primary school who can read at different levelsAll India all rural districts:Representative sample of all children from household survey',\n '% Children in govt schools in Std III who can at least do subtraction: Selected States ASER 2018',\n 'The ASER 2018 graph on the left shows the proportion of Std III children enrolled in government schools who can at least do a numerical two digit subtraction problem with borrowing. (This kind of problem is usually found in Std II math textbooks in states). The All India figure indicates that approximately 21% of children can do this task correctly. However there is wide variation across the country with stats like Kerala, Himachal Pradesh or Punjab where more than 40% children can do this correctly to states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh where this figure is lower than 15%. If we consider these levels as a proxy for the proportion of children who are at grade level in Std III, we can see that a substantial jump is required to help children get close to grade level expectations.',\n 'Over the last fifteen years, Pratham has evolved a solution called Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL) which enables children to acquire foundational skills, like reading and arithmetic quickly. Regardless of age or grade, teaching starts at the level of the child. This is what is meant by “Teaching at the Right level”. The TaRL method developed by Pratham was originally designed keeping in mind children who have already reached Std. III, IV or V but still have not acquired basic skills. The focus is on helping children with basic reading, understanding, expressing themselves as well as arithmetic skills. These are foundational building blocks that help a child to move forward. Studies have shown that once acquired these capabilities endure over time. TaRL is an effective and low-cost strategy that helps children to “catch up” in a short period of time. Children, who are 7 or 8 and older and have been in school for a few years, can “pick up” quickly.',\n '2.Children’s groups are made according to the basic assessment.

In the direct model, Pratham instructors run “Learning Camps”, 30-50 days of instruction (3 to 5 camps of 10 days each), for about 3 hours a day. In the partnership model, government teachers use this approach over a longer period in the school year (four to six months) with dedicated time for 1-2 hours a day.',\n 'Here is an example of learning improvement seen in the 2017-18 Pratham-Goverment of Karnataka Partnership Program for Std.

Pratham’s efforts for the last two decades have been largely focussed on finding a solution for thislearning crisisOver the years, the approach that has evolved is calledTeaching at the Right Levelor TaRL.',\n 'From 2012 to 2017, Pratham had been working directly on helping children in Grade 3 and above,catch upon basic reading and arithmetic. This teaching-learning approach is calledTeaching at the Right Level(TaRL). Targeted at children enrolled in government schools in Grades 3 to 5, these intensive bursts of activity (30-50 days or 3 to 5 camps of 10 days each) ensured that by the end of the last camp more than 70% of children were able to read simple texts fluently and confidently do basic arithmetic operations.',\n 'Building on the successful experiences with the TaRL Learning Camps, by 2017-18, we took several more steps. These steps were based on questions like:',\n 'The overarching challenge was how to durably change the learning situation in a village or urban community such that at least basic skills or foundational literacy and numeracy was taken care of. In 2018, we decided that we should work for three to five years in the communities where we worked “directly”. (Direct interventions are those in which full-time Pratham team members work directly with schools and communities, children and teachers.) We felt it was possible to work towards the goal of all children reading and doing basic arithmetic. Not only could we support children to learn and thrive but also with the help of local people, create engaging learning environments in the community.',\n 'To continue to innovate and evolve, we started the multi-year “Hamara Gaon” (Our Village/Our Community) intervention.',\n 'The three-year goals included ensuring that:',\n 'The overall objective of Hamara Gaon was to understand how in a period of three to five years a village could be enabled in terms of ensuring basic foundations of learning for every child at least for the elementary school age group. We also envisaged Hamara Gaon to be the active laboratory where methods of teaching-learning and materials could be developed, as well as become the locations where impacts on learning could be measured and effectiveness of the approach could be shared more widely with other partners and governments.',\n 'The disruptions and discontinuities due to the COVID-19 pandemic led to many changes in the way that we interacted and engaged with the Hamara Gaon communities. Here are some key elements of our renewed efforts:',\n 'A stronger push for “catch up” is needed to help children recover from the learning losses of the last two years. During the pandemic, we were able to successfully mobilize community volunteers who ran promising TaRL “catch up” learning camps in communities. Thus, along with work with teachers and schools, youth volunteers will continue to play an ongoing role in supporting children’s learning.',\n \"During the lockdown, we engaged directly with families of young children (pre-school age and those who were of Grade 1 and 2 age). We sent them activities to do with their children via phone messages (SMS and WhatsApp). We also connected regularly with families via phone calls for follow up and feedback. We saw mothers participating actively with their children. Young mothers were encouraged to form their own mothers' groups in the neighbourhood and get together regularly to do activities with their children. In the current version of Hamara Gaon, mothers and mother’s groups have emerged as a vital part of young children’s learning journeys.\",\n 'In July 2020, the Government of India launched its New Education Policy (NEP 2020).\\xa0 The document strongly recommends that acquisition of foundational literacy and numeracy in primary grades should have the highest national priority. For us, too, in the next two-three years, it is very important to demonstrate that these national goals are achievable in our local Hamara Gaon communities.',\n 'The Hamara Gaon program is usually implemented in a cluster of25 communities(either villages or urban communities. A team of 5-6 Pratham team members are responsible for transforming this community. In 2022-23, the program was operational in5192 communitiesand reached~3,86,000 children.',\n 'For more information, write to:info@pratham.org',\n 'B- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029Email:info@pratham.orgContact number: 01141651638',\n 'Y.B.

Teachers have attempted to send children learning materials using whatever means were available. At their end, families have tried to support the education of their children in the best way they could. Yet, there is widespread agreement that these efforts have been largely ineffective and significantly uneven. Across the globe, there is serious concern about whether all children will come back to school when once schools reopen. Schools, families, and policymakers are worried about the impact of the pandemic on children’s socio-emotional development and the extent of learning loss that may have occurred.',\n 'As far as schooling is concerned, the COVID crisis has brought unprecedented challenges: for example, children who are enrolled in Grade II today have never been to school and possibly have not had much exposure to pre-school education either. Children in today’s Grade V were finishing Grade III when the pandemic struck. Data from India indicates that even in 2018, more than half of all children in Grade IV could not read a Grade II level text or perform simple 2-digit subtraction. It is very likely at the situation will have worsened in the past year and a half.',\n 'By June-July in a regular year, summer vacations are over, and schools have re-opened after the holidays.

The campaign rolled out across the country in the beginning of August 2021, and is encouraging parents and family members as well as others in the community to join children, engage with them in interesting and fun activities, and help them learn.',\n '(1)\\xa0 Early years learning readinessfor children currently in Grade I and II; via mothers individually and in groups',\n '(2) “Catch up”campaign for children currently in Grade III to VI via local volunteers who conduct instructional activities and games with small groups in the neighborhood.

With almost all children in school, the critical question facing the country is – are children learning?',\n 'Since 2005, ASER - the Annual Status of Education Report - has attempted to answer this question. Facilitated by Pratham, ASER is a nation wide household survey that reaches a representative sample of children in every rural district in India. Over 600,000 children from more than 300,000 households are reached every year. A set of basic reading and arithmetic tasks are administered one on one to each sampled child. In 2018, ASER visited 596 districts across the country.',\n 'Sample: ASER reading and arithmetic tool',\n 'Over ten years of data from the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) point to three key facts:',\n 'Here is a table from ASER 2018 that shows reading levels for Std III to V. Not only do we see a large proportion of children at low levels of reading, but the variation in each grade is wide. For example: In Std V, while 50% of all children can read Std II level text (or even higher), the rest are not yet at Std II level. Close to 18% children are only able to recognize letters or yet to acquire that skill. 13% can read simple words but not sentences and another 19% are just about reading text at Std I level. This situation presents a huge challenge to any teacher. What should a teacher teach? And to whom? In a typical Indian classroom, the Std V teacher teaches from the Std V textbook and thus only the “top of the class” benefits from her teaching.',\n 'ASER 2018: % Children in primary school who can read at different levelsAll India all rural districts:Representative sample of all children from household survey',\n '% Children in govt schools in Std III who can at least do subtraction: Selected States ASER 2018',\n 'The ASER 2018 graph on the left shows the proportion of Std III children enrolled in government schools who can at least do a numerical two digit subtraction problem with borrowing. (This kind of problem is usually found in Std II math textbooks in states). The All India figure indicates that approximately 21% of children can do this task correctly. However there is wide variation across the country with stats like Kerala, Himachal Pradesh or Punjab where more than 40% children can do this correctly to states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh where this figure is lower than 15%. If we consider these levels as a proxy for the proportion of children who are at grade level in Std III, we can see that a substantial jump is required to help children get close to grade level expectations.',\n 'Over the last fifteen years, Pratham has evolved a solution called Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL) which enables children to acquire foundational skills, like reading and arithmetic quickly. Regardless of age or grade, teaching starts at the level of the child. This is what is meant by “Teaching at the Right level”. The TaRL method developed by Pratham was originally designed keeping in mind children who have already reached Std. III, IV or V but still have not acquired basic skills. The focus is on helping children with basic reading, understanding, expressing themselves as well as arithmetic skills. These are foundational building blocks that help a child to move forward. Studies have shown that once acquired these capabilities endure over time. TaRL is an effective and low-cost strategy that helps children to “catch up” in a short period of time. Children, who are 7 or 8 and older and have been in school for a few years, can “pick up” quickly.',\n '2.Children’s groups are made according to the basic assessment. Available teachers or instructors allocated to facilitate group activities and to guide children’s work.',\n '1. Simple one-on-one assessment done to group Std.

While India has open schooling opportunities, there is lack of awareness, accessibility, adequate motivation and support for a student to use open schooling as a way to continue their education.',\n 'Fewer people progressing for higher studies, low quality secondary education, an ever-increasing demand of a skilled labour force reinforces the need for an effective intervention in the secondary education space.A secondary school certificate is a prerequisite for entry into higher education, skill apprenticeship and for promotion in jobs.Pratham believes that by making education accessible and closer to home, it is possible to overcome logistical and social challenges and begin to bridge the gender gap in learning and education.',\n 'Understanding the importance of secondary education, especially Grade 10, Pratham has deployed a focused intervention, the Second Chance program, to enable young girls and women to complete their secondary schooling and forge strong pathways for the future.',\n \"Pratham's Second Chance program focuses on providing school dropouts, especially young girls and women, another chance at education. Second Chance aims to support those who could not complete their secondary education. The program focuses on completion of Grade 10.

The program runs in two phases. The first phase is called theFoundation Course (FC)which lasts for 3-4 months and focuses on basic foundational concepts of subjects likeEnglish, Mathematics, Language (state-specific), Science and Home Science. Assessment in the form of a pre-test at the onset of FC and post-test at the end of FC are conducted to track the learning levels of students and their growth during the course. During this phase, life skills-focused activities are also conducted with the learners, concentrating on enhancement of communication, decision-making and critical thinking skills.',\n 'After the Foundation Course, students move to theMain Coursewhich focuses on helping learners prepare for theBoard-mandated curriculum. The progress during the Main Course is tracked through internal assessments.
